===================
Get-ChildItem-Color
===================

Add coloring to the output of `Get-ChildItem` Cmdlet of PowerShell. In
addition to the original functionality, this provides:

* Color support for `Format-Wide` (`ls` equivalent) case
* Better performance by using `Dictionary` objects instead of regular
  expressions.
